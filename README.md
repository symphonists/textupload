# Text Upload Field

- Version: 0.1beta
- 2011-04-16
- Requirements: Symphony 2.2 or later
- Author: Craig Zheng

## Summary

Allows you to attach text-based files to entries and have the file content itself saved into the system, making it available for formatting, editing, and output. Syncs changes between the original file and saved content, so you can manage it from either end.

- Content can be run through Symphony's text formatters
- Content can be output as CDATA
- Content can be edited in the back end

## Installation

Information about [installing and updating extensions](http://symphony-cms.com/learn/tasks/view/install-an-extension/) can be found in the Symphony documentation at <http://symphony-cms.com/learn/>.

## Beta Notes

This hasn't been tested at all yet. I'll be using it on a couple of developmental projects in the coming weeks, but additional testing would be appreciated. In particular it needs to be beefed up to handle exceptions and errors.
